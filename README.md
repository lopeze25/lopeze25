### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ezekiel Lopez. This is my personal GitHub that showcases some of my interests, with a focus on embedded systems, systems programming, statistical machine learning, and algorithm design.

I'm currently working on various snippets of code and compiled projects for my portfolio back tester and some FPGA and quantum mechanics projects.
